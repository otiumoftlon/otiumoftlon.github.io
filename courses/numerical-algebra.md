# Numerical Algebra

My blog about my learning of Numerical Linear Algebra.

## Why Learn this?

In real life we use computers to calculate math, solve equations, plot functions, and with this you run algorithms in any field. For example in computer vision you are executing edge detection algorithms and then used to indentify objects in a scene (really basic perception of the world) or you are training a neural network with million of parameters example , large language models, meaning that you are adjusting each of them for each iteration for finding the best  set of parameters that minimize the loss function. All of this


## Course references

I am following the open source course "Introductio to Numerical Methods" by Prof. Steven G. Johnson at MIT.

## References
I am using the following books as primary references:
- *Numerical Linear Algebra* (Trefethen & Bau)
- *Fundamentals of Matrix Computations* (Watkins)
