Hi, I am Nicolas, im doing a PhD in robotics and optimization in computer vision for fast inferences, and I want to show my process of learning and progress in this field that I find so interesting and challenging. There is not a journey only about some core topics, but also about how I learn, investigate and do research. 

Personally I consider myself also a data scients so some topics I will try to connect with data science. Nevertheless, these topics an a glance may not interconnect with broader fields, but I think that are they in the core of many other broader fields, such as, bussiness, medicine, etc. For example, optimization is basically oen of the core tools of any machine learning algorithm, and it is also a core tool of any robotics algorithm or computer vision in some extent.

I will try to document my progress and share my knowledge with the community, with my personall tips and insights. Fortunally, I know my weakness areas, so that why I will start with them. So during these early months I will focus on numerical linear algebra and the basis of computer vision. Due to I want to implement fast algorithm and also broaden my knoledge, I will code in C++ and Python. In python I have a lot of experience, but in C++ I am a beginner, if any c++ expert read this, I ask for forgiveness of my code quality.
