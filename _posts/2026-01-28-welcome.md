I am starting to organize my work in Numerical Algebra. My goal is to implement algorithms from standard texts and document the process here.

Currently, I am organizing my PDF references and initial Python/C++ scripts.

Stay tuned for updates on:
- Cholesky Decomposition
- Triangular Systems
- Optimization exercises
