## Welcome to my Numerical Algebra Code Blog

This blog will serve as a documentation of my work in **Numerical Algebra**.

Here you will find:
- Explanations of papers I am reading.
- Implementations of algorithms in **Python** and **C++**.
- Insights into optimization and matrix computations.

Check out the [Projects](projects/numerical_algebra) folder for the raw code.
